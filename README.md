# imba-vim

I'm opinionated about how TUI text editors should work,
so I was interested in implementing my own
(though I should probably just hack on emacs).

I wanted to see how easy it would be to make a
TUI text editor with basic functionality,
and it turns out it's as easy as 100 lines of code.

I don't plan on writing the actual editor I make in imba
since I want to learn lisp, but I'll leave this here to make things
easier for anybody looking to do something similar in the future.
